JM: I have Create-React-App set up and running, in a directory called "tail-react-app", straight off the project root directory ("EvolveU-Project3"). I also have Tailwind working in this directory.

I'm thinking we'll want to use React-Router.  https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/primary-components
Indeed I've gone ahead and set us up with React Router. App.js is now a simple Router demo from the above website.
OK, I embellished this React Router example slightly to make it a super-simple, functional site. I'll give y'all a tour!
